# Cube3DIntersection

This is a test exercise to represent knowledge of architecture, design patterns and following SOLID clean code principles.
Design is represented by Geometry3D.drawio file which may be opened using draw.io website or application with the same name.

Patterns used:
- Strategy: required for following the Single Responsibility Principle (which is the S from SOLID)
- Factory: required to incapsulate logics related to creation (SRP again)
- DDD: required to provide extensibility for the application
